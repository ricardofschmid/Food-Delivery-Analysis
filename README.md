# Food Delivey Analysis
In this project, I explore a Food Delivery dataset. The initial steps involve loading the data and checking some characteristics of the dataset, such as column names, data types, data size, and the presence of null values to understand the dataset's possibilities. Following this, we analyze various aspects of the data to uncover insights and address some questions that might arise.
